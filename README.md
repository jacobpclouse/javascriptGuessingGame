# javascriptGuessingGame
Creating a javascript game where you define a range and then try to guess the number it has selected.

Based on Colt Steele's web dev project, I scripted this after watching his video with a blank file.
I knew the basics from the video, but I felt as though I would learn more doing it again.

I took time the next day to get a blank file and try to recreate it on on my own.
